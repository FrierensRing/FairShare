# FairShare
FairShare is an app that allows users to track the expenses between them and their friends/roommates.
Users can add multiple "Friends" on their Fair Share app to split their spendings later
Click on the wallet icon to input spendings and split the spending by selecting one or more of your friends.
The system automatically will automatically calculate the finantial balance for each person and show whether you someone owes you money or you owe someone.
If someone owes you, the system will display a green box on your user card with the total amount of money that everyone owes you.
I you owe someone, the system will display a red box showing the total amount of money that you owe your friends.
Every "friend" has their own user card and general info about who owes who money would be displayed on it.
Tapping on the user card would show further details about transaction history.
Users can also delete a transaction in the transaction history once someone returns their money, or delete a "friend" if they no longer owes you money.
